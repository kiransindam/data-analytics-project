We can use Excel to create a pivot table and examine the data from the Global Superstore dataset in order to determine whether the company's plan to promote discounts in order to enhance profit was successful or not.

Below are the procedures for making a pivot table and data analysis:

Step 1:Open a new worksheet in Excel after importing the data there.

Step 2:The "Insert" tab is located on the ribbon at the top of the screen. Step 2: Choose the data and click there.

Step 3: To locate the pivot table, click "Pivot Table" and then choose "New Worksheet" or "Existing Worksheet" according to where you want it to be.

Step 4: Drag the following fields to the proper locations in the PivotTable Fields window on the right side of the screen:

Step 5: Choose "Report Layout" from the drop-down menu under the "Design" item on the ribbon at the top of the screen to format the columns.

Step 6: To make the data easier to read, select "Tabular Form."

Step 7: Choose "Stacked Column" chart for the pivot table to find which discount rates increased sales and profit the greatest.

Step 8: Choose a "Line" chart for the total profit and total sales to display the overall effectiveness of the discount approach.

The following inferences can be made based on the analysis of the data from the pivot table and charts:

The majority of product categories saw an increase in sales thanks to the discount approach, particularly the furniture sector.
Discounts did not, however, necessarily result in higher profits. For instance, the 20% reduction reduced profit in the Technology sector.
In general, the discounting technique increased overall sales but had little effect on overall profit.

In conclusion, even though the discounting strategy was effective in boosting sales across the majority of product categories, 
it wasn't always accompanied by an increase in revenue. As a result, before adopting discounts, the corporation must carefully 
consider how they would affect each category.
